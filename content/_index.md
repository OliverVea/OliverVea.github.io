Hi there, my name is Oliver and I'm a software developer currently working at the Danish software company [Hesehus](https://www.hesehus.com/), where we build excellent ecommerce solutions for some of the largest Danish webshops.

I have a great interest in software as a whole, and have worked on projects related to web development, robotics, machine learning, and game development. To hone my skills and display my work, I decided to put this portfolio site together, to tie a nice bow on my various projects.

I also currently reside in Tokyo, Japan, and I am actively looking for work so definitely feel free to reach out, if your company is interested in someone with my profile!
