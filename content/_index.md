Hi there, my name is Oliver and I'm a software developer currently working at the Danish company Hesehus, where we build excellent ecommerce solutions for some of the largest Danish webshops.

I have a great interest in software as a whole, and have worked on projects related to web development, robotics, machine learning, and game development. To hone my skills and display my work, I decided to put this portfolio site together, to tie a nice bow on my various projects.

I'm also currently looking for work in Tokyo, Japan, so definitely feel free to reach out, if your company is interested in someone with my profile!
