    <description><![CDATA[Overview FluentFuzzy is a .NET package for adding fuzzy logic to a project in an easily readable, fluent way. The project is freely available on Github.
I&rsquo;ve written an introductory post on fuzzy logic here, which explains the basic concept and how it works.
The project includes four source projects and a test project.
The FluentFuzzy project contains the code for the core logic and fluent syntax builder of the package.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Introduction As part of developing my dungeon-based RPG, I&rsquo;ve recently been tinkering with fuzzy logic as a way to transform what non-player agents observe into what actions they choose to perform.
The benefit of using fuzzy logic in this way is that given a set of input parameters, I can make human-understandable and -interpretable rules which can result in a very complex output.
I haven&rsquo;t yet integrated fuzzy logic into my game, but I thought I would make an explanatory article, which I can follow up with an update on my side-project afterwards.]]></description>
