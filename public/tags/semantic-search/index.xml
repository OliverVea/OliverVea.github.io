    <description><![CDATA[Overview Recently, I&rsquo;ve been researching semantic search, since elasticsearch 8 has added support for doing vector search as part of an ordinary search request. I&rsquo;ve written a post about this topic, providing an introduction to the uninitiated.
I wanted to build a simple semantic search proof-of-concept project with OpenAI embeddings and searching with the elasticsearch knn option.
The result is this small project with an ASP.NET API, which allows for product ingestion and searching.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Overview Recently, I&rsquo;ve been researching semantic search, since elasticsearch 8 has added support for doing vector search as part of an ordinary search request.
Semantic search is a searching algorithm that builds on the rapid progress made in NLP with deep learning methods. It is possible to get high-dimensional vectors, called embeddings, which approximate the semantic meaning of any text.
To leverage this for searching, all the searchable documents can be embedded with this semantic vector.]]></description>
